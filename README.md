**Logistic Regression Implementation** ðŸ“ˆ

This repository contains a Python implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch. ðŸš€ The LogisRegression class is designed to help you understand and apply logistic regression for binary classification tasks. Key features include:

Sigmoid Function: Transforms predictions into probabilities.

Loss Function: Computes the binary cross-entropy loss to evaluate model performance.

Gradient Descent: Optimizes weights and bias to minimize the loss.

Convergence Check: Monitors loss to ensure the model converges effectively.

To use, simply initialize the class, fit the model with your data, and make predictions. Perfect for learning and experimentation! ðŸ§ âœ¨
